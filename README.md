## Welcome to Holliday!

#### Requirements

* [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
* Bash
* Optional: Knowledge of Markdown

Here's what Holliday is all about. DOCumentation.

All you have to do is:

    source holliday.sh
    start_holliday
    # # the h1-title of my doc
    # ## the h2-section title
    some_cmd
    some_other_cmd
    # **note**: this cmd is dangerous
    dangerous_cmd
    stop_holliday

And you'll get a nicely formatted document in any one of several output
formats.

YEAH BUDDY!
